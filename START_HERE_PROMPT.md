# ðŸš€ AURALO HOODIE TEMPLATE - ADAPTATION PROMPT

## Use This Exact Prompt to Adapt the Hoodie Template:

```
STEP 1: UNDERSTAND THE GOLD STANDARD

First, study the proven Auralo Hoodie implementation that generated $1M+ in sales:

1. Read /AURALO-HOODIE-EXAMPLE.md - The exact hoodie formula
2. Read /index.html - The working template with hoodie elements
3. Read /config/template-config.json - Hoodie's dynamic values
4. Review /images/ - See the exact style of hoodie testimonials and story slides

After studying the hoodie template, confirm you understand:
- The exact 7-slide story arc from "You Are Not For Everyone"
- How the 16 testimonials work (10 Gen-Z TikTok + 6 Millennial Trustpilot)
- The conversion elements that NEVER change (XL popup, countdown, value stack)
- Why the hoodie got 3.2% conversion (vs 1% average)
- The 90/10 rule: Keep 90% exact, customize only 10%

STEP 2: ANALYZE NEW PRODUCT (But Think Hoodie)

Now I will provide you with a product to adapt: [INSERT URL HERE]

Analyze it through the lens of the hoodie success:
1. How can this product use the hoodie's $200â†’$20 price psychology?
2. What's this product's version of "You Are Not For Everyone"?
3. What's the "accidental overstock" story for this product?
4. Who are the Emma/Sophia/Madison equivalents for this audience?
5. How do we create the same 15.7M views viral narrative?

STEP 3: ADAPT THE HOODIE FORMULA

Adapt the proven hoodie template, changing ONLY the product-specific 10%:

1. STORY ADAPTATION (Keep Hoodie Structure):
   - Slide 1: Hook - [Your version of "What if you don't need everyone?"]
   - Slide 2: Problem - [Your "trying to please everyone" equivalent]
   - Slide 3: Discovery - [Your "authenticity matters more" moment]
   - Slide 4: Journey - [Your "18 months perfecting" story]
   - Slide 5: Solution - [Your "hoodie that says it" equivalent]
   - Slide 6: Transformation - [Your "250,000+ chose authenticity"]
   - Slide 7: CTA - [Your "Only 47 left" urgency]

2. TESTIMONIAL GENERATION:
   - 10 TikTok reviews with specific prompts for AI face generation
   - 6 Trustpilot reviews with professional headshot prompts
   - Diverse demographics and authentic voice for each

3. PRODUCT IMAGERY:
   - Main hero shot specifications
   - 6 lifestyle scenarios
   - All image generation prompts

4. COPY ADAPTATION:
   - Headlines that beat competitor by 30%
   - Value stack superior to competitor
   - Urgency more credible than competitor

5. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:
   - SimpleSwap integration with new pricing
   - Image optimization requirements (<50kb)
   - Mobile-first responsive design

STEP 4: BUILD AND TEST

Use Docker and Playwright MCP to:
1. Build the adapted landing page in Docker container
2. Test with Playwright to verify:
   - All images load correctly
   - Checkout flow works
   - Popups trigger at right times
   - SimpleSwap integration functions
   - Mobile responsiveness
3. Check browser console for any errors
4. Take screenshots at each breakpoint
5. Verify conversion elements are prominent

STEP 5: DELIVER

Provide:
1. Complete adapted landing page
2. All 23+ generated images in correct folders
3. Performance metrics showing 40% faster than competitor
4. Conversion optimization report
5. Deployment-ready files

Remember the Hoodie Rules:
- KEEP 90% of the hoodie structure exactly the same
- ONLY change product name, images, and specific testimonial words
- MAINTAIN all conversion mechanics (popups, timers, notifications)
- USE the same 16-testimonial structure (10 TikTok + 6 Trustpilot)
- PRESERVE the $652 value stack format
- COPY the hoodie's mobile-first design exactly
- The hoodie template IS the gold standard - don't reinvent
```

## CRITICAL REMINDERS:

- This is NOT just text replacement - you must GENERATE all visual assets
- Every testimonial needs an AI-generated face/photo
- The story carousel needs 7 complete images with text overlays
- Keep the exact same conversion psychology while changing everything visible
- Test everything in Docker before delivering
