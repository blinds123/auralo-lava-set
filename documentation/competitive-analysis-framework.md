# Competitive Analysis & Autonomous Landing Page Generation Framework

## üéØ Overview
This framework enables Claude to analyze competitor product URLs and autonomously generate a superior landing page using the Auralo Master Template as a foundation. The system will research the market, analyze the product, and create all necessary assets including testimonials, images, and copy.

## üìä Phase 1: Competitor Analysis & Research

### 1.1 Initial URL Scraping
```

Process:
1. Scrape with Jina AI for full page content
2. Extract all images and download locally
3. Capture pricing structure
4. Document unique selling propositions
5. Note brand voice and messaging
6. Identify target demographic
```

### 1.2 Deep Market Research
```
Research Checklist:
‚ñ° Product category analysis (30+ competitor sites)
‚ñ° Pricing strategy comparison
‚ñ° Common pain points in reviews
‚ñ° Trending keywords and hashtags

Generate 6 variations:
1. Clean white background hero shot
2. Lifestyle context shot
3. Detail/texture close-up
4. In-use action shot
5. Packaging/unboxing shot
6. Size/scale reference shot
```

#### Lifestyle Photography
```
Based on target demographic analysis, generate:

    },
    "quality_seeker": {
        "age": "30-40",
        "personality": "Researches before buying",
        "pain_point": "Tired of poor quality",
        "language": "Detailed, specific",
        "platform": "Trustpilot"
    },
    "value_hunter": {

Example output:
"omg this [product] is actually insane... wore it to [relatable event] and literally everyone asked where i got it üòç if you're thinking about it just do it trust me"
```

#### Trustpilot Review Generation (6 Required)
```
