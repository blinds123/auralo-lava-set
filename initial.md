### Supplement ‚Äî FAQ Seeds
**Q: I'm between sizes 38/40 - which should I choose?**
A: Go with your typical size - our structured fabric doesn't stretch out. If you prefer looser fits, size up. Free exchanges if needed.

**Q: How sheer is the Desert Road color?**
A: Not sheer at all. We opacity-test every batch - passes squat tests and strong lighting. Wear any underwear color confidently.

**Q: What's the fabric weight - summer only?**
A: Medium-weight fabric works year-round. Light enough for summer, substantial enough for fall layering. Not tissue-thin like fast fashion.

**Q: Does the waistband stretch out during the day?**
A: No - structured waistband maintains shape. No saggy knees or stretched waists by afternoon [reddit].

**Q: How do I wash these pieces?**
A: Machine wash cold, hang dry. No special care needed. Color stays vibrant wash after wash.

**Q: What if only one piece fits?**
A: Exchange either or both pieces free. Most customers (92%) nail their size first try.

**Q: How fast is shipping really?**
A: 2-3 business days from our US warehouse. Faster than New Arrivals' 5-day made-to-order wait.

**Q: Can I style pieces separately?**
A: Absolutely. Top pairs with everything from denim to skirts. Pants work with basic tees to blazers.
