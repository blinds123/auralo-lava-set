## Technical Implementation

### API Integration Best Practices
```python
# Batch processing for efficiency
def generate_product_images(products, angles):
    images = {}
    for product in products:
        for angle in angles:
            prompt = f"Professional product photo of {product}, {angle} view, white background"
            image = generate_image(prompt)
            images[f"{product}_{angle}"] = image
    return images

# Error handling and retries
def generate_with_retry(prompt, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return generate_image(prompt)
        except Exception as e:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise e
            time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
```

### Quality Optimization Settings
```python
# High-quality commercial settings
settings = {
    "quality": "high",
    "size": "1024x1024",  # Or 1024x1536 for portrait
    "guidance_scale": 7.5,  # For Stable Diffusion
    "num_inference_steps": 50,
    "output_format": "png"  # For transparency support
}
```

### Image Post-Processing Pipeline
```python
from PIL import Image
import requests

def optimize_for_web(image_url):
    response = requests.get(image_url)
    image = Image.open(BytesIO(response.content))
    
    # Resize for different use cases
    sizes = {
        'hero': (1200, 800),
        'product': (800, 800), 
        'thumbnail': (300, 300)
    }
    
    optimized = {}
    for name, size in sizes.items():
        resized = image.copy()
        resized.thumbnail(size, Image.Resampling.LANCZOS)
        optimized[name] = resized
    
    return optimized
```

## Prompt Engineering Best Practices

### Essential Elements for E-commerce
1. **Subject specification:** Exact product name and key features
2. **Background:** "clean white background", "transparent background"
3. **Lighting:** "studio lighting", "professional lighting", "even illumination"
4. **Quality:** "commercial quality", "high resolution", "professional photography"
5. **Composition:** "centered", "product focus", "clean presentation"

### Advanced Techniques
```python
# Multi-prompt weighting (Stable Diffusion)
prompt = """
(professional photography:1.3), black hoodie, 
(studio lighting:1.2), white background, 
(commercial quality:1.4)
"""

# Negative prompting
negative_prompt = """
blurry, low quality, amateur, distorted, watermark, 
text, shadows, wrinkled, poor lighting
"""
```

### Platform-Specific Optimization
- **OpenAI:** Focus on detailed descriptions and technical specifications
- **Midjourney:** Use artistic descriptors and style references
- **Stable Diffusion:** Leverage negative prompts and parameter tuning
- **FLUX:** Emphasize natural language descriptions with specific requirements
