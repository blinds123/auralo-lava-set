## Key Insights

### Landing Page Conversion Baseline
- Average landing page conversion rate across all industries: **5.89%** (HubSpot)
- Median conversion rate should be around **4.3%** (Unbounce)
- For every $92 spent on acquiring web traffic, only $1 is spent on converting those visitors

### The Story Mindset Framework
- **Critical Concept**: The ad is the introduction of your story, and the landing page should continue that same story
- Ad campaigns and landing pages should not be created in isolation
- Messaging between ad and landing page must be consistent
- Landing pages should reassure customers they're at the right place with clear next steps

### Major Landing Page Mistakes

#### 1. Wrong Traffic Destination
- **Problem**: Sending paid traffic to home/product/category pages instead of dedicated landing pages
- **Impact**: Lower quality scores, higher cost per click, reduced ad rankings
- **Solution**: Create dedicated landing page for each campaign

#### 2. Accessibility Issues
- Forcing email capture before allowing product viewing
- Creating barriers too early in the buying journey

#### 3. One-Size-Fits-All Approach
- Using single landing page for all campaigns breaks the story connection
- Landing page creation can't be a one-off project

#### 4. Intent Level Misalignment
- Gap between paid social media traffic intent vs organic traffic intent
- Mobile traffic typically has lower intent levels than desktop
- 40% of mobile traffic is paid vs only 20% of desktop traffic

### Mobile vs Desktop Behavior
- Over 70% traffic share in B2C industries comes from mobile
- Mobile associated with "fun," "simple," cheaper products
- Desktop used for serious activities and expensive purchase decisions
- Customers often research on mobile but complete purchases on desktop

### Landing Page Infrastructure Investment
- Traditional web development cycle too expensive for campaign-specific pages
- Need to systemize and automate landing page creation
- Use landing page builders for quick template-based creation
- Templates should be easily editable by marketing team

### Low-Cost Research Tools
- **Microsoft Clarity**: Free heatmap and session recording tool
- Provides automated text insights for individual sessions
- GDPR and CCPA compliant
- **Case Study**: TurkNet saw 72% increase in service checks and 107% increase in subscriptions by fixing cookie popup visibility issue

### Key Takeaways
1. Web and ad teams must align on customer journey story
2. Landing page creation is continuous optimization process, not one-off project
3. Mobile-first approach essential as younger generations gain purchasing power
4. Avoid upfront system building costs by using proper tools and processes
