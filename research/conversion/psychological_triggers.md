## Core Psychological Principles for Conversion

Understanding human psychology is fundamental to effective marketing. These triggers tap into evolutionary instincts and cognitive biases that influence decision-making.

## The Six Universal Principles of Persuasion (Cialdini)

### 1. Reciprocity
**Principle**: People feel obligated to return favors
**Application in Marketing**:
- Free samples or trials
- Valuable content before asking for purchase

**Conversion Impact**: 15-25% increase in conversion rates
**Examples**:

- "Free shipping on your first order"

### 2. Commitment and Consistency
**Principle**: People want to be consistent with previous decisions
**Application in Marketing**:
- Start with small commitments (email signup)
- Progress through increasing commitment levels
- Reference previous purchases or interactions
- Use commitment-based language

**Conversion Impact**: 20-30% increase in follow-through rates
**Examples**:

### 3. Social Proof
**Principle**: People follow what others are doing

**Conversion Impact**: 25-45% increase in perceived value
**Examples**:

### 9. Cognitive Load Theory
**Principle**: Too many choices or complexity reduces decisions
**Application in Marketing**:
