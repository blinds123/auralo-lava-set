## API Implementation

### Sessions Flow Example
```javascript

const session = await adyen.checkout.sessions({
  amount: { currency: 'EUR', value: 1000 },
  countryCode: 'NL',
  merchantAccount: 'YourMerchantAccount',
  reference: 'YOUR_ORDER_NUMBER',
  returnUrl: 'https://your-company.com/checkout-complete'
});

// 2. Initialize client-side
const checkout = await AdyenCheckout({
  clientKey: 'your-client-key',
  locale: 'en-US',
  environment: 'test', // or 'live'
  session: session
});

// 3. Create payment component
const dropin = checkout.create('dropin').mount('#dropin-container');
```

### Advanced Flow Example
```javascript
// 1. Get payment methods
const paymentMethods = await adyen.checkout.paymentMethods({
  amount: { currency: 'EUR', value: 1000 },
  countryCode: 'NL',
  merchantAccount: 'YourMerchantAccount'
});

// 2. Make payment
const payment = await adyen.checkout.payments({
  amount: { currency: 'EUR', value: 1000 },
  paymentMethod: paymentMethodData,
  reference: 'YOUR_ORDER_NUMBER',
  merchantAccount: 'YourMerchantAccount'
});

// 3. Handle additional actions if needed
if (payment.action) {
  const details = await adyen.checkout.paymentsDetails({
    paymentData: payment.paymentData,
    details: additionalDetails
  });
}
```
