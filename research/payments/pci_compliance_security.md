# PCI Compliance & Payment Security

## PCI DSS Overview

### What is PCI DSS?
**Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)** is a security framework for organizations that handle branded credit cards from major card schemes.

### Current Version: PCI DSS v4.0.1 (June 2024)

### Who Must Comply?
- **Merchants** that accept card payments
- **Service providers** that process card data
- **Payment processors** and gateways
- **Any entity** that stores, processes, or transmits cardholder data

## Compliance Levels

### Merchant Levels (by transaction volume)

#### Level 1 (Highest Risk)
- **6+ million** Visa/Mastercard transactions annually
- **Requirements:** Annual on-site assessment by QSA
- **Report:** Report on Compliance (ROC)
- **Quarterly:** Network vulnerability scans

#### Level 2
- **1-6 million** Visa/Mastercard transactions annually
- **Requirements:** Annual Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ)
- **Alternative:** QSA assessment
- **Quarterly:** Network vulnerability scans

#### Level 3
- **20,000-1 million** e-commerce transactions annually
- **Requirements:** Annual Self-Assessment Questionnaire
- **Quarterly:** Network vulnerability scans

#### Level 4 (Lowest Risk)
- **Fewer than 20,000** e-commerce transactions annually
- **Requirements:** Annual Self-Assessment Questionnaire
- **Quarterly:** Network vulnerability scans (if applicable)

- Install vendor-supplied security patches within one month
- Develop software applications according to PCI DSS
- Follow change control processes

### Implement Strong Access Control Measures

#### Requirement 7: Restrict Access to Cardholder Data by Business Need-to-Know
- Limit access to cardholder data to least needed
- Establish access control systems
- Assign access based on individual job classification
- Require documented approval for privileged user accounts

#### Requirement 8: Identify and Authenticate Access to System Components
- Define and implement policies for proper user identification
- Assign unique ID to each person with access
- Control addition, deletion, modification of user IDs
- Immediately revoke access for terminated users

#### Requirement 9: Restrict Physical Access to Cardholder Data
- Use appropriate facility entry controls
- Distinguish between personnel and visitors
- Physically secure all media containing cardholder data
- Maintain strict control over distribution of media

### Regularly Monitor and Test Networks

#### Requirement 10: Track and Monitor All Network Resources and Cardholder Data
- Implement audit trails to link all access to cardholder data
- Automate audit trail analysis
- Protect audit trail files
- Synchronize all critical system clocks and times

#### Requirement 11: Regularly Test Security Systems and Processes
- Test wireless access points quarterly
- Perform external and internal penetration testing annually
- Use intrusion-detection and/or intrusion-prevention systems
- Monitor critical file and configuration changes

### Maintain an Information Security Policy

#### Requirement 12: Maintain a Policy that Addresses Information Security
- Establish, publish, maintain, and disseminate security policy
- Maintain security incident response plan
- Create security awareness program for personnel
- Implement formal risk assessment process

## Implementation Strategies

### For E-commerce Businesses

#### Using Payment Processors (Recommended)
- **Advantages:** Reduced PCI scope, expert handling, faster implementation
- **Examples:** Stripe, PayPal, Square, Adyen
- **Compliance:** Processor handles most requirements
- **Your responsibility:** Secure website, proper integration

#### Self-Processing (Advanced)
- **Requirements:** Full PCI DSS compliance
- **Costs:** Higher due to assessment and infrastructure
- **Expertise needed:** Security professionals, compliance officers
- **Timeline:** 6-12 months for initial compliance

### Reducing PCI Scope

#### Tokenization
- Replace sensitive data with non-sensitive tokens
- Reduces systems in scope for PCI compliance
- Tokens have no exploitable value
- Original data stored in secure vault

#### Point-to-Point Encryption (P2PE)
- Encrypt data at point of interaction
- Data remains encrypted until processing
- Reduces merchant PCI scope significantly
- Requires P2PE validated solutions

#### Hosted Payment Pages
- Payment forms hosted by processor
- Cardholder data never touches merchant servers
- Minimal PCI compliance requirements
- Reduced security risks

## Security Best Practices

### Network Security
- Segment cardholder data environment
- Use firewalls to protect networks
- Implement network access controls
- Monitor network traffic continuously

### Data Protection
- **Never store:** Full magnetic stripe, CAV2/CVC2/CVV2, PIN/PIN blocks
- **Limit storage:** Only store business-justified data
- **Encrypt data:** Use strong encryption methods
- **Mask displays:** Show only necessary digits

### Access Controls
- **Principle of least privilege**
- **Two-factor authentication** for admin access
- **Regular access reviews**
- **Immediate termination** procedures

### System Maintenance
- **Regular security patches**
- **Vulnerability scanning**
- **Security monitoring**
- **Incident response procedures**

## Common Compliance Challenges

### Technical Challenges
- **Legacy systems** integration
- **Complex network** architectures
- **Third-party integrations**
- **Mobile payment** security
- **Cloud deployment** considerations

### Organizational Challenges
- **Staff training** and awareness
- **Policy development** and enforcement
